# STALKR (Self Transiting Autonomous Lurking Killer Robot)
This Repository contains the Code and other resources used in the STALKR project. The STALKR project is a course project of the [MECH 464 Industrial Robotics Course](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MECH&course=464) at University of British Columbia (UBC). 

The goal of the project was to create a robot that could follow a person using input from an RGB camera.

## Robot Architecture
The Robot is built using the following components:
* iRobot Create 
* Raspberry Pi 4 (with raspian OS)
* Powerbank
* Raspberry Camera

We mounted the components to the iRobot create in the following way:
